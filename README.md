# üîê Smart Lock System with QR Code Access

## Overview

This project is a **Smart Lock System** that uses **QR codes** to let guests open doors without keys. It's designed for places like hotels, rentals, or guest houses.

Guests get a **special QR code** when they check in (on their phone or through a website). This code works only during their stay. They scan the QR code at the door to open it. The system also has a website for managing everything and checking who opened which door and when.
